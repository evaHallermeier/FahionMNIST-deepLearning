## Colab notebook sructure:

### Notebook 1 for part 1 : work only with numpy
insert here table of content

### Notenook 2 for art 2 : work with Keras and matplotlib for visualisations
      Part 2 : Neural Network with Tensorflow Keras (50%)
        - Step 0 Utiles
       -  Step 1 - Data preprocessing
        - Step 2 - Basic model architecture and training
        - Training the basic model on trainig set, Save trained model, Results and evaluation metrics for base model, Predicting and test set results, Making the confusion matrix, Visualization of the accuracy of training vs validation
      - Step 3- Experiment 1: Build the new version for network layers, Evaluate experiment 1
      - Step 4 - Experiment 2: Load trained model, Uploading an image for test, Predicting the result of a single image
      - Test environement with the final model
