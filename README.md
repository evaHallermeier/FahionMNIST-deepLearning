## Colab notebook sructure:

### Notebook 1 for part 1 : work only with Numpy
      Import Libraries
      Load Dataset
      Data preprocessing (5%)
            Feature scaling
            Select two classes : label 0 and 1
            Split the data into Train set and Test set
            Visualize data
      Activation functions (5%) - sigmoid function
      Loss function (10%)
      NN Hyper Parameters
      Weight and Bias Initialization
      Training (15%)
      Results of part 1
            Loss Visualization
            Test your performance (15%)


### Notenook 2 for ×¤art 2 : work with Keras and matplotlib for visualisations
      Part 2 : Neural Network with Tensorflow Keras (50%)
      
       - Step 0 Utiles : import libraries
       -  Step 1 - Data preprocessing :load dataset, define labels, select 2 classes, visualize data images, feature scaling
       - Step 2 - Basic model architecture and training : architecture, training, save model, result and evaluation (visualization of loss and accuracy), running                        test, confusion matrix for test (around 96% accuracy)
       - Step 3- Experiment 1:  architecture, training, save model, result and evaluation (visualization of loss and accuracy), running test, confusion matrix for test                    (around 98% accuracy)
       - Step 4 - Experiment 2: architecture, training, save model, result and evaluation (visualization of loss and accuracy), running test, confusion matrix for test                    (around 99% accuracy)
       - Test environement with the final model: Load trained model, Uploading an image for test, Predicting the result of a single image
