# Deep learning Project - Fashion MNIST
This project is the creation of Deep Learning model using different levels of ML libraries on the dataset FASHION MNIST.


Notebook using Numpy- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ViFafM33HMSyTdyJEeAWvTYqqlYxeuEA?usp=sharing


## Colab notebooks structure:
